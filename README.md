## Description
An accommodation booking site where you can view venues and register a user either as a customer or a manager. As a customer you can book a venue and see your upcoming stays, and as a venue manager you can create new venues, view bookings made to your venues, as well as update and delete your venue. Created with React and tailwind.

## Assignment brief
A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.
